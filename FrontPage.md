## Who Am I

My name is Jason Magri, and I'm currently finishing up my degree in Computer Science at SNHU. Overall, I've been working on becoming a computer scientist for a long time now, ever since I was in middle school. Back then, I started working on simple programs with helper programs, such as Ren.py. I started working on it a lot more seriously once I began working on my degree. I started the journey towards my degree at NHTI, pursuing an Associates in Animation and Graphic Game Programming. After completing my degree there, I got a job in my field. In addition to that, I decided to continue towards my Bachelor's in computer Science. As I was working full time, I determined that the best way to complete my degree was through SNHU. Thus, I began my journey towards my Bachelor's in computer science. Over the course of my classes at SNHU, I learned many things. I learned a lot about how to do testing, as this wasn't a primary topic at NHTI. I learned more about working with databases, such as MongoDB. I also learned how to work with OpenGL, in order to create visual objects from scratch. All of those things, and more, went into creating the projects that we'll see below.

## Informal Code Review

As part of my work in enhancing my projects for this portfolio, I did an informal code review. Although I have done code reviews before, I hadn't done one on my own code, so it was an interesting experience. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxqrUq2FM9I&feature=youtu.be) is the result.

# Projects 

## Software Design and Engineering project: Medical testing software

This project wasn't enterily written by me. Instead, it was a project that I had created tests for. I felt that this was a good project for this goal, as it shows that I can take an existing project, and determine how it works. By writing a set of tests for this project, it shows that I can figure out what is important to the project, and test those specific features. Using these skills, I can search exisiting code for issues, without making changes. This is an important skil when working at a company, as I will often not have the ability to change the code on a whim. [Here](_updated_Milestone 2.zip) is the file.

## Algorithm and Data Structures project: A Sppon

This project creates a spoon in 3D space using OpenGL. It does this by utilizing C++ and a file containing a list of indices. After it pulls the list of indices from the file, it inserts them into a List, which it can reference during runtime. Then, utilizing OpenGL, it displays those on the screen. In addition to the spoon shape, it also uses a texture file to make the spoon look more metallic. Finally, it uses algorithms in order to make the spoon appear to be lit. [Here](Final.zip) is the files.

## Database: Python website

This project is a website with a python frontend, utilizing Bottle. For the backend, it uses MongoDB to store the data. Through the python code, I was able to write a console interface that could pull a variety of stock data from the database. This data included simple things, such as pulling a single item, to more complicated things, such as an aggregated list of the top five industries in the database. [Here](Milestone 4.zip) is the result.
